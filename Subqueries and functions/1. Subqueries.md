## Intro to SQL subqueries

SQL subqueries allow you to run nested queries inside of a SQL statement and generate dynamic data.

```
SELECT guides_title, guides_revenue
FROM guides
WHERE guides_revenue = (
	SELECT MAX(CAST(guides_revenue AS unsigned))
	FROM guides
    );
```

We're using cast/as unsigned because otherwise we don't get the largest value, which is what MAX does. The subquery starts in the WHERE clause.

Another example with a WHERE/IN clause:

```
SELECT *
FROM addresses
WHERE addresses_city IN (
	SELECT addresses_city
    WHERE addresses_state = "NY");
```

## How to Use SQL Subqueries for Insert Statements

Given this code:

```
SELECT *
FROM users;

INSERT INTO users(users_name, users_email)
VALUES("Jon", "jon@snow.com")
```

How do we know what this user's id is if he wanted to write a guide? (The guides have an user id and we'll need to inject one). We could select all the users and go all the way down, but that's a bad practice. Instead, we can use a subquery.

```
INSERT INTO guides (guides_revenue, guides_title, guides_users_id)
VALUES (
	500,
    'Guide by Jon',
    (SELECT users_id FROM users WHERE users_name = 'Jon' LIMIT 1)
);
  
```

The last item (the subquery) will slide into the third param. It's recommended to query ids by email because they will always be unique.

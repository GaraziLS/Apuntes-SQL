## Intro to SQL

Years ago data was stored inside flat files. You would append new records to that flat file. Now doing this allowed you to store and persist your data, meaning that when the program was over you'd be able to still have it there on the system. This had a few issues.

Imagine that you were building a new Twitter and you tried to use a flat file. You'd have some issues because every single time that you created a post and you looked at your feed, you are looking at more than just one type of data element. You may be looking at a tweet but then you also need to know who that tweet belongs to. Which means that you have to have a reference to users, You would also have to have the ability to store how many likes that it got, how many read tweets, and how many responses. There's all kinds of relational data that is there that if you were just trying to keep track of it in a single file or in a single record it would start to get really messy.

**SQL gives us the ability to have relational data**, and by relational, I mean that **you can have all kinds of database tables and you're not limited to a single one**. These tables can all have references to each other. SQL means Structured Query Language.

If you have a tweet, that tweet can belong to a user. That tweet will have a reference to the users table. Then you can very quickly go in the Users table and find out which user created it. You can also quickly see how many times it is retweeted by going to a retweet table. You can see how many ‘likes’ there are and you can see who gave the likes.

## Differences Between Popular SQL Implementations

There are five main SQL implementations. SQL is a language on its own.

* ***MySQL***: It's open source. Most enterprises don't use it because its open source nature. It's also quite old. We'll be using this one in this course.

* ***Postgres***: It's newer than MySQL. It's open source and allows extensions. Ruby devs use this one a lot.

* ***Oracle SQL***: Enterprises uses this one a lot despite being pricey.

* ***MS SQL***: Owned by Microsoft. It's not free.

* ***MariaDB***: It's very new, but has grown very fast in popularity. Due to being newer, it doesn't have the support the others do.

## Installing MySQL in Windows

Just go to [this page](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/) to install MySQL in Windows.

After completing the config process, we'll have MySQL Workbench (a graphical user interface, to visualize the tables) and the command console itself.

## Deep dive: SQL Data types

The main data types are these:

* ***Character*** : **Usually shorted as Char. They're fixed-length strings**, which means that whatever number of characters that you tell the database that you want in that specific column. It is going to have to reserve that in memory.

Now that doesn't mean that you need to take up that full amount. However it's considered a best practice because let's say that you want to have a character set or a column that has 10 characters in it. The way that SQL is going to work is it's going to take up 10 characters in that column in regards to memory space.

They take the 100% of the space allocated and can have up to 255 characters. They must have quotation marks. Names aren't used either, vecause they may vary in length.

They must have a number of characters between ():

```
Char(10)
```

* ***Varchar***: Short for variable character. It's like the char data type, strings as well. It's processing takes longer than chars because they have dynamic memory allocation. They can have up to 65.535 characters and its use is identical to chars'.

```
Varchar(100)
```

* ***Boolean***: True or false values. 

```
BOOLEAN
```

* ***Small Int***: Any integer that goes from 32.768 to -32.768. Decimals won't work (they're truncated). 45,2 it's going to be converted to 42.

```
SMALLINT
```

* ***Integer***: Any integer going from 2147483647 to its negative counterpart. Decimals are also truncated, so will be lost.

```
INTEGER or INT
```

* ***Decimal***: Allows decimals, but only up to 38. It works with two components: precision and scale. The precision is the total number of digits that are stored inside that column, and the scale how many decimal places there's going to be.

```
DECIMAL(4, 3) => 9,834
DECIMAL(7, 2) => 42215.85
```

* ***Float***: If you need more than 38 decimals you can go to floating numbers. It allows for large numbers, and doesn't require precision/scale. It's an aproximation. 9,5 may not be equal to 9,5.

```
FLOAT
```

* ***Datetime***: Used to store data/time type od value. It goes from 1-1-1753 to 31-12-9999.

Date must be written as YYYY-MM-DD

```
DATETIME
```

* ***Clob***: Clob stands for Character Large Object. It's used to store VERY large character-based data, up to 2GB. Using it for small data amounts it's not advised, use a varchar instead.

```
CLOB
```

* ***Blob***: Stands for Binary Large Object. It's used to store large **binary** objects, up to 2GB. It's used when you want to store an image in the database, but nowadays this is rarely done: instead, images are uploaded to servers.

## Creating a Database Schema

A schema is a tool we can use to wrap all of our database tables inside it. To start a achema, we'll open the MySQL Workbench and create a new connection. From there, we'll go to a trople-disk icon with a plus to create our first schema. After giving it a name another window will pop up. SQL already created some code for us.

![Creating a schema](https://github.com/nlarrea/DevCamp/raw/main/02-full-stack/module_09-sql/images/steps/01_create_schema.jpg)

The schema creator will display this line of code (we could paste it in the terminal too):

```
CREATE SCHEMA `schema-name` ;
```

We apply the changes. Now the schema is on the left side, in the Schemas tab. The schema has tables inside, among other things.

Now we've created our first schema.

## How to Create a Table in MySQL

Now we'll create our first table. To do that we'll select the schema we want to work in and click the create a new table icon, just right to the new schema icon. The label will say ``create a new table in the active schema in connected server``. But there's another way. **In the table tag inside the schema**, **right click and select ``create table``**. This one is going to be called ``users``.

![Creating a table](https://github.com/nlarrea/DevCamp/raw/main/02-full-stack/module_09-sql/images/steps/02_create_table.jpg)

Click that and another box will pop up. After giving it a name, we must create some columns or there will be errors. Creating a column isn't as easy as in excel, you need to tell MySQL what type of data it's going to be contained in the column. We're going to double click on the first column and give it a name, ``users_id``. Then we have to specify the datatype.

There are other options, such as checkboxes. One of them is the primary key. If you want to access a unique value inside of the table you wanna make sure that you have some type of identifier number. We need to make sure that every record has a unique id, and that's what primary keys do.

The **varchar** datatype is a string. We can put pretty much anything inside there, and we can change the number of characters allowed -this is indicated between ()- But this time we'll choose an integer because it's gonna be a unique value, and can also be incremented.

We also have a unique type of box, as well as not null (this will make a column mandatory) and auto increment among others.

Thus, we're going to create different columns. An email column, for example, will be unique and not null, and of varchar type.

Last, we won't have foreign keys yet. These foreign keys connect a table to other table.

If we click apply, this code will pop up:

```
CREATE TABLE `sql_course_schema`.`users` (
  `users_id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `users_name` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  `users_email` VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`users_id`),
  UNIQUE INDEX `users_id_UNIQUE` (`users_id` ASC) VISIBLE,
  UNIQUE INDEX `users_email_UNIQUE` (`users_email` ASC) VISIBLE);
```

Now inside the schema tree we have a table with all of its columns.

## How to Create a Table with a Foreign Key in MySQL

Foreign keys connect tables with other tables. First we need to create another table. The second table will have columns for addresses. So we'll have an **id that will be the primary key (it's also going to be not null, unique and auto-incremented),** streets, cities, states and postal codes as columns. We'll also have another column that connects this table to the other one, because the address(es) must be connected to a user. We're not going to make this last column unique because a user can have different addresses.

Now we'll come to the foreign keys tab, which is at the bottom of the UI.

![Foreign key tab](https://github.com/nlarrea/DevCamp/raw/main/02-full-stack/module_09-sql/images/steps/03_create_table_with_foreign_key.jpg)

Here we'll write the ``addresses_users_id`` column name. Then, we'll select the referenced table, in this case ``users``. We also need to select which columns are selected, both in this table and in the referenced one..

![Creating a Foreign Key](https://github.com/nlarrea/DevCamp/raw/main/02-full-stack/module_09-sql/images/steps/04_create_table_with_foreign_key.jpg)

We also have the option to perform actions on update or delete of the table, such as cascading. So in other words what that would mean if a user's deleted then we want to make sure that all of their addresses are deleted as well. That is usually a best practice.

We apply changes and get this code:

```
CREATE TABLE `sql_course_schema`.`addresses` (
  `addresses_id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `addresses_street_one` VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
  `addresses_street_two` VARCHAR(45) NULL,
  `addresses_city` VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
  `addresses_state` VARCHAR(2) NOT NULL,
  `adresses_postal_code` VARCHAR(20) NULL,
  `addresses_users_id` INT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`addresses_id`),
  UNIQUE INDEX `addresses_id_UNIQUE` (`addresses_id` ASC) VISIBLE,
  INDEX `addresses_users_id_idx` (`addresses_users_id` ASC) VISIBLE,
  CONSTRAINT `addresses_users_id`
    FOREIGN KEY (`addresses_users_id`)
    REFERENCES `sql_course_schema`.`users` (`users_id`)
    ON DELETE CASCADE
    ON UPDATE NO ACTION);
```

We now have two connected tables.

## Guide to Changing Columns in MySQL Tables

This lesson walks through how to change a column in a MySQL table. Specifically, we'll examine how to ensure that a foreign key is required for every new record.

We'll edit a table that's already created. To do so, we'll go to the table we want to edit and click on the wrench icon. From there, we can make our foreign key, ``addresses_users_id``, not null, and thus mandatory.

This is going to alter the generated code:

```
ALTER TABLE `sql_course_schema`.`addresses` 
DROP FOREIGN KEY `addresses_users_id`;
ALTER TABLE `sql_course_schema`.`addresses` 
CHANGE COLUMN `addresses_users_id` `addresses_users_id` INT NOT NULL ;
ALTER TABLE `sql_course_schema`.`addresses` 
ADD CONSTRAINT `addresses_users_id`
  FOREIGN KEY (`addresses_users_id`)
  REFERENCES `sql_course_schema`.`users` (`users_id`)
  ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

## How to Add New Columns to a Table in MySQL

In this guide we'll create a new table that contains a relation to the users table. Additionally, we'll go through the steps needed to add a new column to an existing table.

So we'll get this code when we apply changes:

```
CREATE TABLE `sql_course_schema`.`guides` (
  `guides_id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `guides_revenue` DECIMAL NOT NULL,
  `guides_users_id` INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`guides_id`),
  UNIQUE INDEX `guides_id_UNIQUE` (`guides_id` ASC) VISIBLE,
  INDEX `guides_users_id_idx` (`guides_users_id` ASC) VISIBLE,
  CONSTRAINT `guides_users_id`
    FOREIGN KEY (`guides_users_id`)
    REFERENCES `sql_course_schema`.`users` (`users_id`)
    ON DELETE CASCADE
    ON UPDATE NO ACTION);
```

After applying changes we'll add another column to the guides table. So we'll get this code:

```
ALTER TABLE `sql_course_schema`.`guides` 
ADD COLUMN `guides_title` VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL AFTER `guides_users_id`;
```

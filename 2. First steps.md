## Creating a Database Schema

A schema is a tool we can use to wrap all of our database tables inside it. To start a achema, we'll open the MySQL Workbench and create a new connection. From there, we'll go to a trople-disk icon with a plus to create our first schema. After giving it a name another window will pop up. SQL already created some code for us.

The schema creator will display this line of code (we could paste it in the terminal too):

```
CREATE SCHEMA `schema-name` ;
```

We apply the changes. Now the schema is on the left side, in the Schemas tab. The schema has tables inside, among other things.

Now we've created our first schema.

## How to Create a Table in MySQL

Now we'll create our first table. To do that we'll select the schema we want to work in and click the create a new table icon, just right to the new schema icon. The label will say ``create a new table in the active schema in connected server``. But there's another way. **In the table tag inside the schema**, **right click and select ``create table``**. This one is going to be called ``users``.

Click that and another box will pop up. After giving it a name, we must create some columns or there will be errors. Creating a column isn't as easy as in excel, you need to tell MySQL what type of data it's going to be contained in the column. We're going to double click on the first column and give it a name, ``users_id``. Then we have to specify the datatype.

There are other options, such as checkboxes. One of them is the primary key. If you want to access a unique value inside of the table you wanna make sure that you have some type of identifier number. We need to make sure that every record has a unique id, and that's what primary keys do.

The **varchar** datatype is a string. We can put pretty much anything inside there, and we can change the number of characters allowed -this is indicated between ()- But this time we'll choose an integer because it's gonna be a unique value, and can also be incremented.

We also have a unique type of box, as well as not null and auto increment among others.

Thus, we're going to create different columns. An email column, for example, will be unique and not null, and of varchar type.

Last, we won't have foreign keys yet. These foreign keys connect a table to other table.

If we click apply, this code will pop up:

```
CREATE TABLE `sql_course_schema`.`users` (
  `users_id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `users_name` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  `users_email` VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`users_id`),
  UNIQUE INDEX `users_id_UNIQUE` (`users_id` ASC) VISIBLE,
  UNIQUE INDEX `users_email_UNIQUE` (`users_email` ASC) VISIBLE);
```

Now inside the schema tree we have a table with all of its columns.

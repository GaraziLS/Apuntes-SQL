## Intro to functions

Aggregate functions. What they mean is that it takes a big collection of data or it takes whatever collection of data your query is and then it returns a single result. So, in other words, an aggregate function would take all of the revenue numbers and it would just tell you what the total was or for the count function.

## How to Change the Data Type of a Column from String to Decimal for Financial Data in SQL

So right now if we try out a function that we already know about which is the “MIN” function. If I try this on guides_revenue from guides and if I run this it's going to supposedly run without error. 

```
USE devcamp_sql_course_schema;

SELECT MIN(guides_revenue) FROM guides;
```

Except that it brings back a 1000 and that is not what we're looking for because if we run ``SELECT * FROM guides`` you can see that our minimum should actually be 500 and this is because we have a varchar inside of our database with the guides revenue, when it really should be a floating-point get away with just casting this which is what we've done before. So we can say cast guides revenue and then we can say as unsigned.

```
SELECT MIN(CAST(guides_revenue AS UNSIGNED)) FROM guides;
```

Doing this can be quite tedious, and we can change data types by clicking on the little wrench icon that appears when hovering on the table. We change the guides_revenue to float and now we don't have to use casting.

## How to Use the: MIN, MAX, SUM, AVG, and COUNT Functions in SQL

We'll be looking at common functions in SQL. They're aggregate functions (they examine a whole column and return a single value).

They structure is:

```
SELECT Function(Column)
FROM Table;
```

* ***Min***: Brings the smallest value of a column. 

* ***Max***: Brings the largest value of a column. 

* ***Avg***: Short for average. Returns the average of a column.

* ***Sum***: Sums all the values of a column.

* ***Count***: This one is a little different in structure. It counts values.

```
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM users;
```

This returns the total of records in a table. We can also narrow the search:

```
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM addresses
WHERE addresses_state = "NY";
```

This would count the addresses that have that state inside them.

## How to Generate Summary Reports in SQL with GROUP BY and Aggregate Functions

We can also count items and group them by name/value. 

```
addresses_state	COUNT(addresses_state)
NY	                3
AZ	                1
```

Another example:

```
SELECT guides_users_id, SUM(guides_revenue)
FROM guides
GROUP BY guides_users_id;
```

In this code, we're selecting a column, we're adding the revenue from the guides table and are grouping that data by user id to see how much revenue each user has.

## Syntax for Adding Comments to a SQL Script

There are two ways of adding comments in SQL.

```
-- This is a comment
-- in multiple lines

# This is an inline comment
```

## How to Turn Safe Mode Off in MySQL

Safe mode exists to avoid accidental actions. It's disabled via preferences or via a command.

```
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0
```

With the safe mode disabled, if we type this (without specifying the table) all the values would get changed.

```
BEGIN;
UPDATE addresses
SET addresses_city = 'Oops';

SELECT *
FROM addresses;

ROLLBACK;
```

This could be useful when seeding or populating large quantities of data all at the same time.

## How to Add a New Column in SQL and Fill It with Randomized Sample Data

This guide walks through how to add a new column in MySQL Workbench, and then how to populate the new column with randomized data by leveraging the SQL RAND() function.

So we'll add a new column in the guides table. If we select the entire table, the new column will have a value of 0 in each of the columns.

In order to populate it, we'll use the RAND() function, but first we'll turn the safe mode off to modify all the columns at once.

```
use devcamp_sql_course_schema;

SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;

BEGIN;
UPDATE guides
SET guides_qty = rand()*1000;
ROLLBACK;

SELECT *
FROM guides;
```

This will update the random quantity column with random numbers up to 1000. Run first the Update portion along with the safe mode off, then run the Select * one in order to work.

## How to Implement Calculated Fields in SQL

This guide provides a step by step walk through for how to build a SQL query with calculated fields. This will allow you to perform mathematical calculations on data in the database at query time to build summary reports. We can do computations on the query:

```
SELECT
guides_title,
guides_revenue,
guides_qty,
guides_revenue / guides_qty
FROM guides;
```

And the system will return the division. These are called calculated fields and you can perform + - * /.

## Adding Custom Row and Cell Names in SQL

You can use name rows to display data better, especially when large quantities of data are involved.

This code:

```
SELECT 'Email:', users_email, 'Name:', users_name
FROM users;
```

Gives this:

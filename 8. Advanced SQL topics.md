## Guide to Understanding and Working with SQL Indexes

Let's imagine that we have a ton of records. If we inspect a table by clicking in the little info icon, we'll see an index tab. Everytime you create a primary key or a foreign key an index is created as well. You can also create indexes manually for a given column. Indexes can search ai item by its row number, thus accessing the data directly.

## SQL Database Normalization Techniques

Database Normalization is essentially a set of best practices and guidelines to allow us to efficiently build and model our database.

* We don't want to have duplicate values. A user can be connected to the address, but it shouldn't be in the same table.

* Use integers instead of varchars for numeric values.

* Mantain the names consistent.

* Define the columns correcty. There's data that should be unique, for example.

## How to Work with EER Diagrams in SQL in Order to Model Database Tables and Data Relationships

In this guide, we're going to talk about diagram modeling and specifically, we're going to talk about our diagrams and the way that you can generate those is if you hit **control + r** that is going to bring up the reverse engineer database dialog box. And also if you go up to the drop-down where it says database you can also access it.

Select the database you want to work with and the database will become a diagram. You could build an entire database with this.

## CRUD Section Introduction

In this section we're going to walk through how to implement the full set of CRUD features into your database.

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete.

So what that essentially means is you're going to be able to add records to your database, run SQL queries, and be able to see what is contained in your database.

You will be able to edit, update which means to change records in your database. Youâ€™ll be able to delete or remove records. So we're going to talk about each one of the statements and how to define them in order to implement that in your database.

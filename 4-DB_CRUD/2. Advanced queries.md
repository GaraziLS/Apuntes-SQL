## How to Run a SQL Query Using Ranges

This guide examines how to leverage the BETWEEN constraint to query data that fits inside or outside of a specific range of values.

First, we're going to select the guides, and then, we're going to type this:

```
SELECT * 
FROM Table
WHERE Column BETWEEN low_range AND high_range;
```

To select things outside the range, we write NOT BETWEEN.

```
SELECT *
FROM guides
WHERE guides_users_id not between 10 AND 30;
```

This would bring all of the guides, because there are no ids ranging from 10 to 30.

## Guide to Wildcard Queries in MySQL

A wild card search gives us the ability to actually search through the string value inside of one of the columns.

```
SELECT * FROM devcamp_sql_course_schema.guides
WHERE guides_title LIKE "%My%";
```

This will select all the guide titles that have a "my" inside. This is not case sensitive. If you want, you can omit the starting or the ending %, this will narrow the search.

## Writing Cleaner SQL Code with the WHERE/IN Command

There's a cleaner way of writing queries. 

We could do something like:

```
SELECT *
FROM addresses
WHERE addesses_city = "Queens"
OR addresses_city = Manhattan"
```

But we can do it better with a WHERE IN sentence. That from above can also be written like this if we want to get multiple results:

```
SELECT *
FROM addresses
WHERE addesses_city IN ("Queens", "Manhattan")
```
